# SnakeGame

This Snake game is a classic arcade game implemented using Python programming language and data structures. It utilizes linked lists to represent the snake's body and queues to manage the game's logic. The SFML library is used for graphical rendering and input handling, providing a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

Features:
Classic Snake gameplay, Data structure implementation (linked lists and queues), Python programming language, SFML library for graphics and input, Cross-platform compatibility

Data Structures:
Linked Lists: The snake's body is represented as a linked list, where each node represents a segment of the snake. This allows for efficient addition and removal of snake segments as the game progresses.

Queues: The game's logic, such as food generation and score tracking, is managed using queues. This ensures that events are handled in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner, maintaining the game's flow and complexity.

Python Programming:
The game is implemented using Python, a versatile and expressive programming language. Python's object-oriented features and rich libraries make it an excellent choice for developing interactive games like Snake.

SFML Library:
The SFML library provides a high-level abstraction for graphics and input handling, enabling the creation of cross-platform games. It simplifies the process of rendering game elements, capturing user input, and handling events.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:
The game is designed to be cross-platform compatible, allowing it to be played on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This expands the game's reach and accessibility to a wider audience.

This expanded description provides a comprehensive overview of the Snake game, highlighting its features, technology stack, and gameplay instructions. It also emphasizes the use of data structures and the SFML library in the game's development.
