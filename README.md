# Snake Game

This file contains a Python implementation of a classic Snake game using Turtle graphics library. It features a green background with a moving blue snake that grows as it consumes red food squares while avoiding its own tail and the edges of the screen. Players can control the snake direction using arrow keys or 'WASD'. Collisions result in resetting the snake to its initial position, clearing the board, updating scores, and generating new food. The game includes a scoring system and keeps track of both current and highest scores.
